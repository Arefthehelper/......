To install the Android SDK (Software Development Kit) and NDK (Native Development Kit) on your Windows laptop, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK)
The Android SDK requires Java, so start by installing the JDK:

1. Download the JDK from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK from the [AdoptOpenJDK website](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).
2. Install the JDK by running the installer and following the prompts.

### 2. Download Android Studio
The easiest way to get the Android SDK and NDK is by installing Android Studio, which includes the SDK by default and provides an easy way to manage NDK installations.

1. Visit the [Android Studio download page](https://developer.android.com/studio).
2. Download the installer for Windows.
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts to install Android Studio. During installation, make sure the option to install the Android SDK is checked.

### 3. Set Up the SDK and NDK

#### Option 1: Using Android Studio (Recommended)

1. **Open Android Studio**:
   - Open Android Studio and complete the initial setup wizard.
   - During setup, it will download the necessary SDK components.

2. **Install SDK Components**:
   - Go to **File > Settings > Appearance & Behavior > System Settings > Android SDK**.
   - In the "SDK Platforms" tab, select the Android versions you want (e.g., Android 12.0 (S), Android 11.0 (R)).
   - In the "SDK Tools" tab, select "Android SDK Build-Tools", "Android Emulator", "Android SDK Platform-Tools", and "NDK (Side by Side)".
   - Click "Apply" to install the selected components.

#### Option 2: Using Command Line Tools

If you prefer not to install Android Studio, you can download the command-line tools:

1. Download the Command Line Tools:
   - Visit the [Android Studio download page](https://developer.android.com/studio#cmdline-tools).
   - Scroll down to the "Command line tools only" section and download the package for Windows.

2. Extract the Command Line Tools:
   - Extract the downloaded `.zip` file to a directory, for example, `C:\android-sdk`.

3. Set Up Environment Variables:
   - Open the **System Properties** (Right-click on "This PC" > "Properties" > "Advanced system settings").
   - Click on "Environment Variables".
   - Add a new user variable named `ANDROID_HOME` with the value set to the SDK directory (e.g., `C:\android-sdk`).
   - Add `%ANDROID_HOME%\cmdline-tools\latest\bin` and `%ANDROID_HOME%\platform-tools` to the `PATH` variable.

4. Install SDK and NDK Components:
   - Open a Command Prompt and navigate to the tools directory:
     ```bash
     cd C:\android-sdk\cmdline-tools\latest\bin
     ```
   - Use `sdkmanager` to install SDK and NDK components:
     ```bash
     sdkmanager --install "platform-tools" "platforms;android-33" "build-tools;33.0.0" "ndk-bundle"
     ```
   - To install a specific NDK version, run:
     ```bash
     sdkmanager --install "ndk;23.1.7779620"  # Replace with the version you need
     ```

### 4. Verify the Installation

To verify that everything is installed correctly:

1. Open a Command Prompt.
2. Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   adb --version
   ndk-build --version
   ```
   This should display the version numbers of `adb` and `ndk-build`, confirming successful installation.

### 5. Done!

Your Windows laptop should now have the Android SDK and NDK installed, ready for development.
