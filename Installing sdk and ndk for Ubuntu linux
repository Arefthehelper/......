To install the Android SDK (Software Development Kit) and NDK (Native Development Kit) on Ubuntu 24.04, you can follow these steps:

### 1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK)
The Android SDK requires Java, so start by installing the JDK:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
```

### 2. Download Android Command Line Tools
The Android SDK can be installed via the command line tools. Download the command-line tools from the official Android developer website:

1. Visit the [Android Studio Download page](https://developer.android.com/studio).
2. Scroll down to the "Command line tools only" section.
3. Download the Linux package.

You can also use `wget` to download the package directly:

```bash
wget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/commandlinetools-linux-10406996_latest.zip
```

### 3. Extract the Command Line Tools

After downloading, extract the package:

```bash
unzip commandlinetools-linux-*.zip -d ~/android-sdk
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

Add the Android SDK tools to your system path. Open your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

Add the following lines at the end of the file:

```bash
# Android SDK
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/android-sdk
export PATH=$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$PATH
export PATH=$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$PATH
```

Reload the shell:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 5. Install the SDK Components

With the command line tools installed, you can now use the `sdkmanager` to install the necessary components:

```bash
sdkmanager --sdk_root=$ANDROID_HOME --install "platform-tools" "platforms;android-33" "build-tools;33.0.0"
```

Replace `android-33` and `build-tools;33.0.0` with the versions you need.

### 6. Install the NDK

To install the NDK:

```bash
sdkmanager --sdk_root=$ANDROID_HOME --install "ndk-bundle"
```

If you need a specific version of the NDK, you can list available versions and install one:

```bash
sdkmanager --list
sdkmanager --sdk_root=$ANDROID_HOME --install "ndk;23.1.7779620"  # example for a specific version
```

### 7. Verify Installation

To verify that the SDK and NDK are installed correctly, you can check the versions:

```bash
adb --version
ndk-build --version
```

This should display the version numbers of the tools if the installation was successful.

### 8. Optional: Install Android Studio

If you also need the Android Studio IDE, you can install it via the following commands:

```bash
sudo snap install android-studio --classic
```

This will provide you with a complete Android development environment.

### 9. Done!

You should now have the Android SDK and NDK installed on your Ubuntu 24.04 system.
